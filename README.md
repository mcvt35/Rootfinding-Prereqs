# Rootfinding-Prereqs
This repository is meant to contain LaTex and python3 files for rootfinding project prerequisites.

LaTex and PDF files are contained in the Assignments folders. All exercises come from the book *Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms - An Introduction to Computational Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra* 4th ed. by Cox, Little, and O'Shea.

Python projects and algorithm example files can be found in the PythonEssentials Complete folder. This includes exercises from the Brigham Young University ACME curriculum as well as python examples of algorithms described in Cox *et al*'s text.

The following is a list of exercises from the above-mentioned text that I've found useful to review:

* Chapter 1
    * 4.2
    * 4.9a
    * 5.4
* Chapter 2
    * 4.1
    * 5.8
